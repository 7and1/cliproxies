### Feature Announcement Email

```
Subject: New: Custom Provider Endpoints & Enhanced Monitoring

Hi [Name],

We're excited to announce two major updates to CLIProxyAPI:

CUSTOM PROVIDER ENDPOINTS

You can now connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint to CLIProxyAPI. This means:

- Local LLMs (Ollama, LocalAI)
- Custom fine-tuned models
- Internal proxy servers
- Beta provider endpoints

Configuration example:

custom-providers:
  local-llama:
    base-url: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    api-key: "sk-local"

ENHANCED MONITORING

New metrics and dashboards help you track:

- Requests per provider
- Token usage and costs
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates and failover events

Access via the Management API or integrate with Prometheus.
